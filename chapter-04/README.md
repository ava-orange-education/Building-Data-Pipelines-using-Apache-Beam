# Chapter 04 


## Layout

- `chapter-04/java/Main.java` – single-file Java example (Flink Runner + KafkaIO)
- `chapter-04/python/script.py` – Python example (ReadFromKafka + WriteToKafka)
- `chapter-04/java-project/` – Maven skeleton with a `pom.xml`
- `chapter-04/python-project/` – Python skeleton with `requirements.txt`

> Note: Some snippets in the chapter were presented without full surrounding boilerplate (e.g., class/method wrappers).
> The files here include minimal, standard wrappers so they compile/run.
