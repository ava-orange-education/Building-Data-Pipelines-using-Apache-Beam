```

## Notes

- `Main.java` and `script.py` contain *multiple independent snippets* separated by headers that preserve the surrounding manuscript context.
- Some snippets are illustrative and may omit imports, pipeline options, or runner setup. Combine or adapt as needed.
- Anything that wasn’t clearly Java/Python (or looked like config/commands) is in `misc/snippets.txt`.
